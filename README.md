## Inspiration
Blood transfusion saves lives and improves health, but many patients requiring transfusion do not have timely access to safe blood. As a result, nearly 12,000 individuals die every day due to a lack of availability of blood. The lack of knowledge and awareness about blood transfusion in many parts of the globe is a significant contributor to this problem. In January 2022, the American Red Cross declared its first-ever national blood crisis due to a severe blood shortage resulting from complications of the COVID-19 pandemic, which further emphasizes the urgent need to address this issue.

## What it does
The website aims to make the process of blood donation/transfusion more mainstream and accessible to a larger audience, making the process more streamlined. In addition, the easy-to-use website makes connecting prospective blood recipients with the nearest blood banks and donors quicker. Furthermore, you can find an option to donate blood voluntarily on the website, which ensures a safe blood supply since people are more inclined to donate blood as an option rather than doing it compulsorily. All of this complements the Sign-in/Sign-up and Profile section on the website, which displays the records of blood donated and received by the individual, thus enabling you to keep track of your health records. To further help you with this, the website has a conversational AI bot which helps with your queries.

## How we built it
We first planned the website's layout and design using HTML and CSS, utilizing Bootstrap to make the website responsive and mobile-friendly. Next, we used JavaScript and jQuery, a JavaScript library, to add interactivity, dynamic functionality, and other interactive elements. After having done this, we integrated Google Firebase to handle backend operations, such as database management and real-time updates. Google DialogFlow was employed to create a conversational AI-based chatbot to allow for a more engaging user experience and prospective NLP capabilities. All of this came out to the world by being tested and deployed on GitHub Pages.

</br>

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into troubles while integrating Firebase to the website and Google DialogFlow to Google Cloud, to which YouTube came to the rescue.  

</br>
</br>

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
1. Created a dynamic website, with varied modern tech tools.
2. Integrated Firebase, a cloud-based platform, to handle backend operations for effective real-time retrieval of data.
3. Gained valuable insights about the healthcare industry.

</br>
</br>

## What we learned
Through this project, we have learned a lot about blood donation and transfusion and about the healthcare sector in general. The project was also an opportunity for us to learn how to make a fully-functional front-end website with a real-time database.

## What's next for RedWish
1. Adding functions like blood testing and organ donation, as well as a chatbot to assist users in navigating the website and scheduling appointments.
2. Providing effective methods for the healthcare sector to preserve given blood after doing data analysis utilising machine learning (ML) models.
3. Writing blog posts about health topics and ways to avoid illness.
4. Finding a way to make the website commercially viable.
