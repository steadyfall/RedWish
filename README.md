# RedWish
An online platform which connects people to the easiness of blood donation-transfusion.


## Inspiration
Blood transfusion saves lives and improves health, but many patients requiring transfusion do not have timely access to safe blood. As a result, nearly 12,000 individuals die every day due to a lack of availability of blood. The lack of knowledge and awareness about blood transfusion in many parts of the globe is a significant contributor to this problem. In January 2022, the American Red Cross declared its first-ever national blood crisis due to a severe blood shortage resulting from complications of the COVID-19 pandemic, which further emphasizes the urgent need to address this issue.

## What it does
The website aims to make the process of blood donation/transfusion more mainstream and accessible to a larger audience, making the process more streamlined. In addition, the easy-to-use website makes connecting prospective blood recipients with the nearest blood banks and donors quicker. Furthermore, you can find an option to donate blood voluntarily on the website, which ensures a safe blood supply since people are more inclined to donate blood as an option rather than doing it compulsorily. All of this complements the Profile section on the website, which displays the records of blood donated and received by the individual, thus enabling you to keep track of your health records.

## How we built it
We started with HTML to create the basic structure of the website. We then used CSS to control the layout and design of the website, like font size, color, and spacing. It was also used to make the website responsive to look good on different devices and screen sizes. Next, we used JavaScript to add interactivity, dynamic functionality, and other interactive elements. jQuery, a JavaScript library, made it easier for us to work with JavaScript and HTML. Finally, we used Bootstrap, a framework that helped us create responsive and mobile-friendly websites. We involved pre-built CSS classes in creating a consistent design across different devices and screen sizes.
